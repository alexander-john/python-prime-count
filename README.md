# Prime count analysis!
### Conclusion!

Using my 2015 macbook pro I was able to analyze the most efficient way to implement the prime count program.
What's strange is that when I timed the programs with the time library I got different execution times.
But the proof has been presented and the NumPy optimization is the clear winner.
